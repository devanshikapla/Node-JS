The repository includes practice with basic Node.js modules such as uuid, nodemon, http, path, fs (file system), and os.

Event:
Description: The Event module in Node.js provides a mechanism for handling and responding to asynchronous events in a program.
Usage: Developers can create custom events, emit them when certain conditions are met, and define listeners to respond to these events.


Path:
Description: The Path module is used for handling and manipulating file paths. It provides methods to work with file and directory paths independently of the operating system.
Usage: Developers can use the Path module to ensure correct path formatting and perform operations such as joining paths and extracting file extensions.


OS:
Description: The OS module provides methods for interacting with the underlying operating system. It allows developers to retrieve information about the system, such as the platform, architecture, and memory usage.
Usage: Developers can use the OS module to gather system-related information and make decisions or optimizations based on the operating environment.


UUID:
Description: The UUID module is used to generate universally unique identifiers. These identifiers are typically employed to ensure the uniqueness of entities in various applications.
Usage: Developers can use the UUID module to generate unique identifiers for elements like database records, ensuring their distinctiveness across the system.


HTTP:
Description: The HTTP module in Node.js allows the creation of HTTP servers and handling of HTTP requests and responses. It is a core module that facilitates building web applications.
Usage: Developers can use the HTTP module to create server-side logic, handle incoming HTTP requests, and send appropriate responses.


FS (File System):
Description: The File System module provides methods for interacting with the file system. It allows reading from and writing to files, creating directories, and performing various file-related operations.
Usage: Developers can use the FS module to manipulate files and directories, such as reading from or writing to files, checking file existence, and managing file permissions.


URL:
Description: The URL module provides utilities for working with URLs, including parsing and formatting. It simplifies tasks related to handling and manipulating URLs in web applications.
Usage: Developers can use the URL module to parse incoming URLs, construct URLs dynamically, and extract information such as query parameters.



I had also created a basic server using the http and fs modules in Node.js, which can host HTML, CSS, and JPEG files for an application. (code is in index.js file) 

basic Server Creation:
The server is created using Node.js's built-in http module, which allows handling HTTP requests and responses.

File System Interaction:
The fs module is utilized to interact with the file system. This is crucial for reading files, such as HTML, CSS, JSON  and JPEG files, from the server's file system.

Handling URL Paths:
The server logic involves handling different URL paths. If the root path ('/') is requested, it defaults to serving an 'index.html' file.

Content Type Determination:
The server determines the content type of the requested file based on its file extension. This is important for indicating to the browser how to interpret and display the content.

Supported File Types:
The server supports different file types, including JavaScript ('.js'), CSS ('.css'), and JPEG images ('.jpeg' or '.jpg'). The content type is adjusted accordingly.

Error Handling:
The server includes error handling. If a requested file is not found (404 Not Found), an appropriate response is sent. Internal server errors (500) are also handled and reported.

Server Listening:
The server is set to listen on a specific port (3000) and host address ('127.0.0.1'). Once the server is running, a message is logged to the console indicating its address and port.
